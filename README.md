# Chatty Frontend

### Goals:

-   End-to-End Encryption

### File Structure

Big fan of how Angular projects are structured, so going to be using [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@motcowley/angular-folder-structure-d1809be95542) and [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)
as inspirations.
